# Keylogger
Created a keylogger using Python in PyCharm. Utilized the pynput module.

pynput is a third party module, not included in the Python default installation.

Install pynput by doing the following:
1) Open Command Prompt
2) Use command 'pip install pynput' to install. This step only works if the "add Python to path" checkbox is checked when installing. Uninstall and reinstall Python with this corrected setting if an error occurs.
3) Return to your IDE and import the pynput module
