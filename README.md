# Keylogger
pynput is a third party module not included in the default Python installation.

Install pynput by doing the following:
1) Open Command Prompt
2) Use command 'pip install pynput' to install. This step only works if the "add Python to path" checkbox is checked when installing Python. Uninstall and reinstall Python with this corrected setting if an error occurs during the pynput installation process.
3) Return to your IDE and import the pynput module
